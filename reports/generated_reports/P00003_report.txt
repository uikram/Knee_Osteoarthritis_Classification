KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS ASSESSMENT REPORT
Generated: 2025-11-12 17:11:38
Report Type: AI-Assisted Preliminary Analysis

============================================================

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
The AI model has classified this knee X-ray as Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3 
with 98.4% confidence. Moderate multiple osteophytes, definite narrowing of joint space, some sclerosis and possible deformity of bone contour

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
  Grade 0: 0.0%
  Grade 1: 0.0%
  Grade 2: 1.6%
  Grade 3: 98.4%
  Grade 4: 0.0%

EXPLAINABLE AI FINDINGS:
The model's attention (Grad-CAM) highlights the following regions:
  - Peak attention at coordinates (3, 1) with intensity 1.00
  - 4.1% of the image shows high model attention (>0.7)
  - Predominantly medial compartment involvement


RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Comprehensive pain management strategy
  • Referral to orthopedic specialist recommended
  • Consider intra-articular injections (corticosteroids/hyaluronic acid)
  • Evaluate for assistive devices (knee brace, walking aids)
  • Follow-up in 3-6 months
  • Discuss surgical consultation if conservative treatment fails

LIMITATIONS:
This is an AI-assisted preliminary assessment. Final diagnosis must be confirmed 
by a qualified radiologist with clinical correlation. The AI model has been 
trained on standard posteroanterior knee X-rays and may not generalize to 
atypical presentations or imaging protocols.
