KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS ASSESSMENT REPORT
Generated: 2025-11-12 17:11:38
Report Type: AI-Assisted Preliminary Analysis

============================================================

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
The AI model has classified this knee X-ray as Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 0 
with 44.5% confidence. No radiographic features of osteoarthritis

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
  Grade 0: 44.5%
  Grade 1: 42.8%
  Grade 2: 12.6%
  Grade 3: 0.1%
  Grade 4: 0.0%

EXPLAINABLE AI FINDINGS:
The model's attention (Grad-CAM) highlights the following regions:
  - Peak attention at coordinates (4, 1) with intensity 1.00
  - 6.1% of the image shows high model attention (>0.7)
  - Relatively balanced medial and lateral compartment attention


RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • No immediate treatment required
  • Encourage regular physical activity and weight management
  • Routine follow-up in 2-3 years or if symptoms develop

LIMITATIONS:
This is an AI-assisted preliminary assessment. Final diagnosis must be confirmed 
by a qualified radiologist with clinical correlation. The AI model has been 
trained on standard posteroanterior knee X-rays and may not generalize to 
atypical presentations or imaging protocols.
