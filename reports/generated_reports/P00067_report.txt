KNEE OSTEOARTHRITIS ASSESSMENT REPORT
Generated: 2025-11-12 17:11:38
Report Type: AI-Assisted Preliminary Analysis

============================================================

CLINICAL IMPRESSION:
The AI model has classified this knee X-ray as Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 4 
with 100.0% confidence. Large osteophytes, marked narrowing of joint space, severe sclerosis and definite deformity of bone contour

PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION:
  Grade 0: 0.0%
  Grade 1: 0.0%
  Grade 2: 0.0%
  Grade 3: 0.0%
  Grade 4: 100.0%

EXPLAINABLE AI FINDINGS:
The model's attention (Grad-CAM) highlights the following regions:
  - Peak attention at coordinates (3, 5) with intensity 1.00
  - 6.1% of the image shows high model attention (>0.7)
  - Predominantly lateral compartment involvement


RECOMMENDATIONS:
  • Urgent orthopedic referral required
  • Evaluate candidacy for total knee arthroplasty
  • Aggressive pain management and functional support
  • Short-term follow-up (1-3 months) until surgical decision
  • Patient counseling on surgical options and outcomes

LIMITATIONS:
This is an AI-assisted preliminary assessment. Final diagnosis must be confirmed 
by a qualified radiologist with clinical correlation. The AI model has been 
trained on standard posteroanterior knee X-rays and may not generalize to 
atypical presentations or imaging protocols.
